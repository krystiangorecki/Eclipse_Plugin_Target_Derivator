This Eclipse plugin (developed on Eclipse 3.7.1) is for Maven users who want to mark the target/build folders as derived resources.
The point is to hide the derived resources when searching for resources (with i.e. Ctrl+Shift+R). After a mvn clean, the target
folders are recreated, and the plugin will help to mark these new folders as derivated.

To install the plugin, copy the latest jar-file under plugins/ to your Eclipse plugins/ folder. Restart Eclipse.
